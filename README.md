<h3>TKpayWalletExchange</h3>
I've completed a 5-week Java Bootcamp which was given by Boğaziçi Üniversitesi,
After the bootcamp,we directly moved into a 1 week Hackathon program and developed a "Wallet with Currency Exchange" project as a FinTech innovation with a team where I played the role of Fullstack Java Developer.

Project included :
SpringBoot(MVC) , JDK-17 , MAVEN , Thymeleaf , REST API , HTML-CSS , JavaScript , AJAX 
technologies.

Our project highly appreciated by all of the jury members at HACKATHON presentation cause of our project's featured innovative functionalities, 
such as wallet-type exchange capabilities within the TKPAY wallet application.
